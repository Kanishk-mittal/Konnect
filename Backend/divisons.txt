The division in our colleges are as follows and for each we need a group

Based on year of admission one group for each year
2021
2022
2023
2024

Based on batch
- Each admission year has 3 batches

Based on department (independent of batch)
- ECE
- CSE
- CSY
- AI&DS 

so for lets say 2021 admission we will have 8 groups
- 2021-Batch-1
- 2021-Batch-2
- 2021-Batch-3
- 2021-Batch-4
- 2021-ECE
- 2021-CSE
- 2021-CSY
- 2021-AI&DS

..... similarly for other years

point to note roll number has following format
YYYY(BCY/BEC/BCS/BCD)XXXX

here YYYY is year of admission
BCY/BEC/BCS/BCD is branch code
XXXX is a 4 digit number padded with 0's in the left

each student will be a part of 3 groups lets us assume that the roll_number of the student is 2023BCY0003
1. Admission 2023
2. 2023_Batch_3 
3. 2023-CSY
4. IIIT-Kottayam (This will be a gorup for all students)
